If mild conditions return and a morning drawing is needed again, we will discontinue the self check-in system and return to morning drawings. If you are interested in hunting on the ice or in the dry fields you are still required to obtain a daily tag. Daily tags are available in the drop box room located by the entry door to the headquarters. Call the waterfowl information line (314-877-6019 Ext 2) to see which system we are using prior to making your hunting plans. All special regulations regarding waterfowl hunting remain in effect as if we were still having morning drawings. This will be the last report for the season unless we resume the morning drawings.","Area_ID":9736}]}
